# YourChore

It's much more than a todo app. It's not only about managing task, it's mainly about who did chore last time ðŸ˜‚. Often, siblings fight over to avoid doing chore arguing about who did it last time. Now they got no excuse. YourChore brings a fun idea to manage task between siblings, relatives. The main idea is: someone has to do it.
